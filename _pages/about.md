Hi, my name is Kyle LeBlanc! 

I am a Senior Mac System Engineer from New England. I have been in IT professionally since 2010, built my first PC in 2008, and vividly remember the first time I went to Google and learning to double-click on an old square track-ball mouse in 1990-something. 

This blog is intended to serve as a place to share my findings, research, thoughts, and expirements with all (most) things technical. I primarily focus on macOS, Jamf, Enterprise IT, and PC Building. Just becuase these are my primary focuses, does not mean I won't post about other things as well - I'm trying to not put myself into a subject box. 

Nowhere on this blog do I claim to know everything - please take all scripts, policies, config profiles, etc with a grain of salt, YMMV. That being said, if you know of a better way to do something, or see errors in my work, please reach out! I am always learning, exploring, and evolving. 

**I like:** loud music, [running](https://gorun.myportfolio.com), the ocean, lots of coffee, early mornings, traveling, thrifting <br/>
**I dislike:** pretentiousness, greed, the dentist, artichokes
