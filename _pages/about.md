Hi, my name is Kyle LeBlanc! 

I am a Senior Mac System Engineer from New England. I have been in IT professionally since 2010, built my first PC in 2008, and vividly remember the first time I went to Google and learning to double-click on an old square track-ball mouse in 1990-something. 

This blog is intended to serve as a place to share my findings, research, thoughts, and expirements with all things relating to my jounrey in game development. I fondly remember modding TES: Oblivion all trhroughout High School and recently decided to begin my own journey in developing indie games. My current career is failing to bring me any form of enjoyment of fullfillment so I hope this scratches my itch for the intersection of art and technology.
