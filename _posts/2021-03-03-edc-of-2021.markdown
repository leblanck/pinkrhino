description: My updated EDC for 2021
featured: true

This past year has certainly taught me one thing: **be prepared for anything.** You never know what situation
you will find yourself in, maybe I need a Phillips head screwdriver, or a flash light, or a USB drive,
etc. 2021 is the year I vow to try and be prepared for as many situations as possible.

After bringing inspiration from my own day-to-day life and from some interesting collections on [Everyday Carry](https://everydaycarry.com), I have
put together an EDC set of my own. This is broken down into 2 sets: True EDC, and Extended EDC. My True EDC is a set of tools
I truly bring with my every-time I leave the house, honestly they are with me as long as I am wearing pants. My Extended EDC is a kit I bring with me
when I am heading out for the day and plan to be out for an extended period of time (>1 hour-ish). 

### True EDC
