### Problem

I recently got fed up with getting tangled in the wire of my wired headset during a meeting. It had in-line volume control that I would always hit when trying to un-tangle and turn the volume to 0 causing me to miss conversation during meetings. My solution: get a wireless headset! I am switching from a Razer Kraken in Black to the Corsair Virtuoso RGB Wireless Headset in White. 

I am not going to go very in-depth with this review, there are better reviews for that and some excellent YouTube videos that cover these in depth. Here are some that informed my own buying decision: [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDPU1XmgQpk), [HardwareCanucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXw_kI1tKvs&feature=emb_title)

### Solution

As we all know style is a very subjective thing, and I will vote that these are pretty visually appealing. They are substantially less obnoxious than other "gaming" headsets which I personally thing is a huge win. I purchased the white version, to match all of my other peripherals and with the RGB option I was able to get them to match perfectly which is always a fun/nice bonus.
