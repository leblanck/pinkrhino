I have always favored 3D games over 2D games. I vividly remember pulling all-nighters to play things like TES: Oblivion, Battlefield 2 & 2142, Halo 3, etc. These were all things that helped shape my teenage years. I knew as soon as I wanted to create a game that it would be a 3D game. Seems like there is no better place to start than with learning [Blender](https://www.blender.org). 

This was a far less daunting experience than what I was prepped for. I have a good amount of experience with the Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc) and Blender is really the same thing (sort-of). Once you learn the tools and different brushes and keyboard shortcuts then things really start to fall into place. 

Below you can see my very first 3D creations which are all included shapes in Blender, but just using these I was able to learn a lot. Things like adding materials, lighting, adding new objects, different render engines and even just moving around the 3D space was all new but after running through this simple tutorial/class/lesson I greatly increased my confidence in doing basic things in Blender. I should now be able to hopefully white-box my ideas in a more efficient way in Blender or UE4.

I was able to accomplish the above and learn a great deal by following this video on YouTube:
